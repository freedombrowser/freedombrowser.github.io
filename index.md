## About
Freedombrowser is a website we created mainly for students at schools with stirct censorship of websites & games. We are hoping to stop this censorship by hosting various services games proxies and many more.

Our main domain is freedombrowser.org but we have multiple other domains; if one is blocked then just use another one. You can view our domains [here](./domain-index.md).
Recently we have been branching out and starting to develop our own software so we thought, why not make it public?
